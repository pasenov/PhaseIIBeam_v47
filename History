Version 1 was the primary version with a few errors.

1/2/2018 Version 2: Changed the number of bins, minimum and maximum limits of histogram in proton.mac.

1/2/2018 Version 3: Changed the type of fNbElectronsStrip1, fNbElectronsStrip2 in RunAction.hh from G4double to G4int.

22/2/2018 Version 4: Added two couples of BPIX modules (one in front of and one behind the DUT). Calculating the entrance point of the primary proton inside Pixel Detector 1 and its exit point from Pixel Detector 2.

23/2/2018 Version 5: Decreased the thickness of pixel modules. Calculating the deflection angle of the primary track between the two pixel modules and filling with it histogram 84.

1/3/2018 Version 6: Local electric field added to each strip sensor. Global electric field could be added through ElectricFieldSetup.

7/3/2018 Version 7: Positions of primary inside strip sensors 1 and 2 displayed.

9/3/2018 Version 8: Midpoints of primary inside each detector displayed.

13/3/2018 Version 9: Let A = fPointPix1mid, B = fPointDet1mid, C = fPointDet2mid, D = fPointPix2mid. Let dB = distance between B and AD and dC = distance between C and AD. Histograms filled with dB and dC for each event.

13/3/2018 Version 10: Let B' be the AD point with same z as B. Let C' be the AD point with the same z as C. Histograms filled with B'Bx, B'By, C'Cx, C'Cy for each event.

13/3/2018 Version 11: Bug in filling the histograms per strip fixed.

15/3/2018 Version 12: World material changed to air.

20/3/2018 Version 13: Kinetic energy of secondaries calculated and could be printed out.

Versions 14 and 15 were non-working and full of bugs.

11/4/2018 Version 16: Possibility for 2S DUT rotation about the x-axis added.

11/4/2018 Version 17: Strips a and b for each sensor separated.

12/4/2018 Version 18: Changed "Air" material. Added CO2 and ArgonGas to it.

3/5/2018 Version 19: Changed titles of histograms 119-122.

Version 20 was the same as Version 19, but with different numbers of bins, min and max values in histograms.

25/5/2018 Version 21: Histograms and ntuples filled with number of hits per strip. We consider that when the deposited energy in the volume of a strip exceeds 5000 X 3.67 eV [5000 e = signal threshold for a valid hit, 3.67 eV = energy needed for the production of an electron-hole pair], then we have a hit.

21/6/2018 Version 22: Hit multiplicity redefined (per event). Scintillator added. Pixel layer added to pixel detectors.

25/6/2018 Version 22: Calculation of x- and y-coordinates of impact points.

Version 23 was a trial version to find the mistake in the rotation matrix of the DUT.

29/6/2018 Version 24: Calculation of z-coordinates of impact points.

8/7/2018 Version 25: Attempt to calculate stored energy inside each pixel-volume.

12/7/2018 Version 26: Calculation of number of hits per pixel module.

14/8/2018 Version 27: Calculation of average positions of primaries in Sensors 1 and 2 according to the centroids of the strip surfaces. Charge weighting included.

17/8/2018 Version 28: Check in every event if hits in Sensor 1 correspond to hits in Sensor2. Output printed after the end of each run. Bug with weights = 0 fixed. Pure detector resolution histograms added (reconstructed coordinate - real coordinate of primary particle in each sensor).

27/8/2018 Version 29: Impact points of primary protons in BPIX modules defined with respect to the centroids of pixels. The above positions in the pixel modules are plotted in histograms 203-208.

7/9/2018 Version 30: Seed selection option added in proton.mac.

8/9/2018 Version 31: Bug with fixing histograms 117 and 118 (which were filled with nan in a few cases) removed.

17/9/2018 Version 32: Weights of strips removed.

17/9/2018 Version 33: Bins of hit multiplicities fixed.

19/9/2018 Version 34: Reco-y splitted in three different histograms (y = -45 um, y = 0 um, y = 45 um).

27/9/2018 Version 35: Reco-y check per event option added: printing of every extrapolated and reconstructed position.

9/10/2018 Version 36: General particle source added. Changes made in PrymaryGeneratorAction and proton.mac. sigma of beam included.

10/10/2018 Version 37: Changed beam shape to ellipsoid and removed sigma.
